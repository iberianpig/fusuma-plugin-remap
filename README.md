# Fusuma::Plugin::Remap [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-remap.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fusuma-plugin-remap) [![Build Status](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-remap/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-remap/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml)

## Installation

**THIS PLUGIN IS EXPERIMENTAL.**

A Fusuma plugin for remapping keyboard events into virtual input devices. Compatible with other Fusuma plugins.

This plugin empowers users to manipulate keyboard events and convert them into virtual input devices. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with other Fusuma plugins, thus enabling users to construct sophisticated input configurations and achieve distinctive functionalities. A key feature is the dynamic alteration of remapping layers within the Fusuma process, thereby enabling users to adapt their keyboard inputs to suit specific tasks or applications.

This plugin requires [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma#update) 2.0

```sh
$ sudo gem install fusuma-plugin-remap
```

### Set plugin properties

Open `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml` and add the following code at the bottom in primary context(first section separated by `---`).

```yaml

  inputs:
    remap_keyboard_input:

## Properties

### Remap

Currently, remapping is only possible in the thumbsense context.
Please install [fusuma-plugin-thumbsense](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-thumbsense)

First, add the 'thumbsense' context to `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.
The context is separated by `---` and specified by `context: { thumbsense: true }`.

## Example

Set the following code in `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.

```yaml

---
context: 
  thumbsense: true

remap:
  J: BTN_LEFT
  K: BTN_RIGHT
  F: BTN_LEFT
  D: BTN_RIGHT
  SPACE: BTN_LEFT
```
